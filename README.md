# Tauri + SvelteKit

Work in progress svelte + tauri app that could be used to document in school. 
Working idea: Open seminar pdf, and get a md document that is parallel to the pdf-document. When taking notes in the md it should be location specific to the pdf-slide. When done and saved, the md-document should be converted to pdf and then fused together with the pdf.
